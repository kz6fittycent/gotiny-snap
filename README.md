# GOTINY SNAP

## A basic snap for the amazing GoTiny.cc API

### Create tiny URL's from your terminal!

**Fast:**   
   GoTiny is stripped down to just the bare minimals for extremely fast performance. 
   With an average processing time of just ~34ms, nothing comes between you and long URLs.
  
**Secure:**   
  Privacy is important. GoTiny does not handle, collect or store any user information. 

**Accessible:**   
   You get a short link! You get a short link! Everybody gets a short link! 
  
**Usage:**   
   * From your terminal, type: `gotiny`
   * Paste or type your long URL
   * The new gotiny.cc URL is printed for you
